"""ASAP connection-release behaviour, independent of the underlying pool.

This module contains the only real logic of the package: a mixin that releases
the database connection back to the pool *as soon as possible*. It does not know
(and must not care) which pool sits underneath — Django's native ``psycopg``
pool or the third-party ``dj_db_conn_pool`` (SQLAlchemy ``QueuePool``). Both
return the connection to their pool when :meth:`DatabaseWrapper.close` is called,
which is all this mixin relies on.

    """Release the connection back to the pool As Soon As Possible.

    Except when you are in an Atomic block — then the connection is released
    after the block ends.

    You can control the transaction manually (``set_autocommit(False)``), then the
    connection is released when the transaction ends — when ``commit``/``rollback``
    is called. That means ``set_autocommit(False)`` affects only until the
    ``commit``/``rollback`` call. After it you need to call ``set_autocommit(False)``
    again.

    You can also set autocommit to ``False`` as the default option for this driver.

    Motivation:

        The main problem of a plain pool is that it holds the connection after the
        first query and releases it only when the surrounding context (e.g. the
        request) finishes. That is, having made one query to the database, we keep
        the connection until the whole current context is done. This greatly limits
        the number of simultaneously running contexts: threads fight for connections
        and may fail to get one. Connections hang idle and are not used, although
        other threads may need them.

    Solution: release the connection ASAP — after each ``execute_sql`` when possible.
